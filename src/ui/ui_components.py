# the way we will handle components is we will be setting up first smaller components as functions (e.g. a Forms with a text box and a submit button)
# these components are then spawned inside card/bigger div components. these larger components are functionality based and a single card/div covers an
# overarching function-theme (e.g. trading system backtesting results visualization, daily inference computation)
# these overarching modules are rendered by a page-renderer. having this three-tiered modularity allows for hx-swaps to take place efficiently,
# changing divs/components as required by a given trigger

# given the fact certain components will be generated differently based on user inputs (e.g. the daily inference section dashboard will render a different
# stock based on dropdown choice, but it could also render a completely different type of graph based on future functionalities). hence the reason we 
# render components inside functions (we could always add a new function input, and an if else statement that renders a different component based on the conditional)
# and function include a try except finally clause that makes sure we always keep the page structure even if a specialized component failed to render correctly
# there would then exist a generic backup that takes its place (the error is logged, and we do show a time-limited toast to the user letting it know there was an
# error rendering that specific component)

# LAUNCHER SCREEN COMPONENTS

# launcher should include a card at the center with the usd logo as a .svg, an enter button that could be either an ikon or a button,
# and a brief description, in our case we could start with a placeholder phrase. usd motto or something.

# on buton click should send to the trading screen, but we could setup up a loader intermediary (at first we manually force a 2 seconde wait)
# and then the loader component redirects to the actual screen. routes and requests are handled on the app.py

# Trading screen components

# trading screen should be composed by a navbar (scrollspy, anchored to the top with all overarching sections mentioned),
# a first section for daily inference, and a second section for backtesting dashboards, and a footer that redirects to our "docs" (which is another screen)
# entirely. docs don't describe the code, but rather the system as a whole (data processing, feature engineering, model architectures, etc... more on docs later)

# each section should have a title/header a brief description, and a divider line

# daily inference section

# here we have side bar (takes 33% of the screen on the right side) that includes:
# a date range, to allow the user to select a date for prediction (start with single day only). dates prior to march 1st 2026 should spawn a toaster
# that warns that date was included on the model training, toast should last for 3 seconds, disappear, but a warning icon should remain on the sidebar.

# a small "today's" data checkmark should allow the user to automatically select today's date for inference

# a dropdown for the given stock we are inferencing should be included, the dropdown options should be (at first) a set of 10 hard-coded stocks defined on the
#component function as a list

# the side bar should also include a compute inference button (which should trigger an inference_call @rt)
# the inference_call @rt takes the data from the side_bar as a whole, unpacking the dropdown and date values and for now printing them out only.

# the inference bar (the other 67% of the screen on the left-side)
# should be composed of a table like structure (takes about 30% of the container), that includes resulting statistics
# such as ohclv data, prediction, sharpe ratio, expected profit

# the 37% left of the inference bar should be left for a plot of the stock to be render (candle-bar graph), which librasry to use for rendering yet
# to be decided

# backtesting dashboards

# the backtesting dashboards section should be based upon the MonsterUI dashboard example (https://monsterui.answer.ai/dashboard/)
# and allow the user to understand (four different sections):

# overall system performance (in terms of profit and risk), per stock performance (dropdown), baseline statistics 
# (what calls the system made the most, etc), baseline statistics in terms of the EDA

# docs footer
# docs footer should be minimalistic and send to the documentation screen

# full page renderer (trading screen), to be triggered by an @rt call

# documentations screen should follow the same format as the nymo whitepaper (https://nymo.finance/whitepaper/). NOT BY ANY MEANS THE SAME AESTHETIC!
# full .htmx, as (everything on this ui), divided into sections, with a side-bar on the left that allows for navigation between the different sections,
# and section description displayed on the remaining right side
